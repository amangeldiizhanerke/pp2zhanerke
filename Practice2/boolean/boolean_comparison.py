# Example 1
print(10 > 9) #Compares 10 and 9, prints True
print(10 == 9) #Compares 10 and 9, prints False
print(10 < 9) #Compares 10 and 9, prints False


# Example 2
a = 200 #Value of variable a
b = 33 #Value of variable b

if b > a: #Checks if b is greater than a
    print("b is greater than a") #Printed if condition is True
else:
    print("b is not greater than a") #Printed as condition is False
