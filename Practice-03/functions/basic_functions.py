#example 1:
#In Python, a function is defined using the def keyword, followed by a function name and parentheses:

def my_function():
  print("Hello from a function")
#This creates a function named my_function that prints "Hello from a function" when called.

#example 3:
#To call a function, write its name followed by parentheses:
def my_function():
  print("Hello from a function")

my_function()
